lab3front.py

This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the restaurant data obtained from the back-end script.
It includes multiple window classes for main window, dialog window, and display window, allowing users to select cities, cuisines, and view restaurant details.
The script fetches data from the SQLite database and displays it in an organized and user-friendly manner.
